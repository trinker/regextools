----------

Releases will be numbered with the following semantic versioning format:

&lt;major&gt;.&lt;minor&gt;.&lt;patch&gt;

And constructed with the following guidelines:

* Breaking backward compatibility bumps the major (and resets the minor 
  and patch)

* New additions without breaking backward compatibility bumps the minor 
  (and resets the patch)

* Bug fixes and misc changes bumps the patch
